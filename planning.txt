====== Removing Uneeded Bits of Code ======

all crafting aspects
crafting grid no longer required
drops will not be required any longer
tools are not required, although keep bronze, iron and steel weapons for PVP

"maybe" keep aspects to collecting materials and forging for weapons?

weapons are, ax, sword, (maybe dagger?)
can also include armour and shields
would like to have bows in all wood classes (maybe)
using levels of power attributed to the wood type
flint and obsidian arrowheads.

possibly keep health, hudbar code for PVP
PVP will need aspects of survival, hunger, thirst, health, etc.. (so keep)

Dyes can go? possibly unsure yet.



 Quite a bit is still just ideas in the works.
But, basically a creative, building environment, with PVP/Adventure/Quest capabilities.


*** mapgen ***

Just thoughts on what I would like to be able to do/see

Implement a cold/snow biome at higher altitudes only (MgV7)

Implement medium/large bodies of water at higher altitudes (MgV7 & MgFlat)

Implement (MgV7 type ridges/rivers) into (MgFlat) as an option, as mountains & lakes
